		KEY OBJECTIVE OF DUM 2020
	</h1>
	<p>
		As India embarks on its smart grid journey, it is imperative that we do not make the same mistakes but learn from each other's experiences. Given the nebulous nature of smart grids, which have been described as a journey more than a destination, as well as the fact that there is no single architecture, standard, etc., there is immense value to utilities in sharing best practices, lessons learned, challenges faced, etc., in addition to collectively stating needs which will be relevant for solution providers as well as policymakers and regulators.
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Key objectives of the Distribution Utility Meet would be:</b><br><br>
		•  Brainstorm how to cope with the new-normal and preparing for the next-normal post- Covid-19<br>
		•  Discuss and evaluate new and emerging technologies, business models and monetization options for utilities<br>
		•  Discuss digitalization of processes and operations of utilities leveraging existing systems at incremental cost<br>
		•  Discuss case studies and best practices from across the globe<br>
        •  Evaluate regulatory, policy, financial and business challenges of DISCOMs for digitalization and remote working and operations

		ABOUT DISTRIBUTION UTILITY MEET 2025
	</h1>
	<p>India's power sector stands at a transformative crossroads—where legacy systems converge with cutting-edge technologies, and visionary policies meet urgent climate goals. As the world's third-largest energy consumer, India is not merely adapting to the global energy transition—it is leading it with purpose and resolve. With a bold national target of installing 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, the government has launched a series of impactful programs aimed at reimagining energy generation, transmission, and consumption.</p>
	<p>Initiatives such as the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, PM-KUSUM, National Green Hydrogen Mission and the Nuclear Mission are democratizing access to clean energy, empowering rural and urban consumers alike. Strategic schemes like the Green Energy Corridor and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for solar modules and advanced chemistry cells are supporting domestic manufacturing. Energy storage systems have also gained infrastructure status, paving the
way for large-scale deployment of battery and pumped hydro storage solutions.</p>
<p>Maharashtra, one of India's most economically advanced states, exemplifies this transition. With electricity demand projected to rise at a CAGR of over 4% till 2033-34, the state is enhancing its power mix through renewables, flexible grid infrastructure, and distributed generation. Recent reforms by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC)—including landmark tariff reductions across consumer categories, promotion of Time-of-Day billing, and incentives for EV charging and Solar-powered agricultural feeders—are setting new benchmarks for affordable and
sustainable electricity.</p>
<p>In this context, the 9th Edition of the Distribution Utility Meet (DUM 2025) will take place in Mumbai, Maharashtra on 06-07 November 2025, in collaboration with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and Tata Power Company Limited and with the support of Energy Department of the Government of Maharashtra. DUM 2025 will provide a unique platform for all the DISCOM community to share each other's experiences in dealing with efforts towards energy transition, grid modernization and digitalization on a fast track as we leapfrog towards a Net
Zero power sector in India. In the post pandemic world, it is imperative that utilities do not make the same mistakes but learn from each other, and from global expertise/experiences. Experts from leading utilities from USA, Europe, South Korea and Japan will be invited to participate in DUM 2025 and share their valuable experiences.</p>
<p>All India Discoms Association (AIDA), the newly launched collaboration platform of Discoms is the Supporting Partner for DUM 2025.</p>
