		Key Objective of DUM 2019
	</h1>
	<p>
		As India embarks on its smart grid journey, it is imperative that we do not make the
same mistakes but learn from each other&#39;s experiences. Given the nebulous nature of
smart grids, which have been described as a journey more than a destination, as well
as the fact that there is no single architecture, standard, etc., there is immense value
to utilities in sharing best practices, lessons learned, challenges faced, etc., in
addition to collectively stating needs which will be relevant for solution providers as
well as policymakers and regulators. 
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Key objectives of the Smart Utility Forum and the workshop would be:</b><br><br>
		•  Evaluate Regulatory, Policy, Financial and Business Challenges of Discoms for Sustainable Solutions<br>
		•  Discuss and Evaluate New and Emerging Business Models and Monetization Options<br>
		•  Emerging Technologies, their Benefits and Brainstorm Demonstration Projects<br>
		•  Discuss Case Studies and Best Practices from Across the Globe<br>

To meet the above objective the first Distribution Utility Meet(DUM) was hosted by Bangalore Electricity Supply Company(BESCOM) with ISGF as a Knowledge Partner. DUM was organized as a 2-days Smart Utilities Forum scheduled on 29 &30th November 2017 in Bangalore. It provided a unified voice to influence and enable the Discom community to leverage each other's experiences for successful nationwide smart grid roll outs. The Dum was a strategic pilot form of the Indian utilities community to help each other achieve business goals, by gaining the insights and influence to improve smart grid technologies and close the gap between strategy and execution.<br><br>

Dum 2017 was a huge success and received accolades from all over India primarily from the utility sector.Leading utilities from USA, Canada, Europe and Japan also participated in Dum2017 and shared their experiences in implementing Smart  Grid Technologies.
