		Key Objective of DUM 2019
	</h1>
	<p>
As India embarks on its smart grid journey, it is imperative that we do not make the same mistakes but learn from each other's experiences. Given the nebulous nature of smart grids, which have been described as a journey more than a destination, as well as the fact that there is no single architecture, standard, etc., there is immense value to utilities in sharing best practices, lessons learned, challenges faced, etc., in addition to collectively stating needs which will be relevant for solution providers as well as policymakers and regulators. 
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Key objectives of the Smart Utility Forum and the workshop would be:</b><br><br>
		•  Evaluate Regulatory, Policy, Financial and Business Challenges of Discoms for Sustainable Solutions<br>
		•  Discuss and Evaluate New and Emerging Business Models and Monetization Options <br>
		•  Emerging Technologies, their Benefits and Brainstorm Demonstration Projects<br>
		•  Discuss Case Studies and Best Practices from Across the Globe<br>
