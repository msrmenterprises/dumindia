		KEY OBJECTIVE OF DUM 2020
	</h1>
	<p>
		As India embarks on its smart grid journey, it is imperative that we do not make the same mistakes but learn from each other's experiences. Given the nebulous nature of smart grids, which have been described as a journey more than a destination, as well as the fact that there is no single architecture, standard, etc., there is immense value to utilities in sharing best practices, lessons learned, challenges faced, etc., in addition to collectively stating needs which will be relevant for solution providers as well as policymakers and regulators.
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Key objectives of the Distribution Utility Meet would be:</b><br><br>
		•  Brainstorm how to cope with the new-normal and preparing for the next-normal post- Covid-19<br>
		•  Discuss and evaluate new and emerging technologies, business models and monetization options for utilities<br>
		•  Discuss digitalization of processes and operations of utilities leveraging existing systems at incremental cost<br>
		•  Discuss case studies and best practices from across the globe<br>
        •  Evaluate regulatory, policy, financial and business challenges of DISCOMs for digitalization and remote working and operations

		ABOUT DISTRIBUTION UTILITY MEET 2025
	</h1>
	<p>The electric utilities in India are on the cusp of a major digital transformation. The 250 million smart meters being rolled out on fast track is going to be the foundation of this profound digital transformation. The recent launch of <b>PM Suryoday Yojana</b> with the target of 10 million solar rooftop systems (up to 30 GW cumulative capacity) is going to fundamentally change the architecture and operating regime of the distribution grids. Another newly launched program <b>Vision 2030: PM Public Transport Sewa</b> is envisaging 600 km of electric highways, replacement of 800,000 diesel buses with electric buses including 50,000 school buses. This would require MW-scale power connections at thousands of bus depots across the country, necessitating major upgrade to the distribution grids in India. With several concurrent programs demanding drastic re-designing of the distribution grids running at fast pace, DISCOMs are on their heels again! They have no time and scope for making errors or delays, hence the very motto of Distribution Utility Meet (DUM) of <b>“Experience Sharing and Learning from Each Other”</b> is more relevant than ever!   
<br/><br/>
ISGF has the pleasure of inviting key stakeholders in the DISCOM domains to the 9th Edition of Distribution Utility Meet <a href="http://www.dumindia.in/">(DISTRIBUTION UTILITY MEET )</a> in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India on 06 to 07 November 2025 in partnership with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and the Tata Power Company Limited. DUM 2025 will be supported by All India Discoms Association (AIDA).DUM 2025 will provide a unique platform for all the DISCOM community to share each other's experiences in dealing with efforts towards energy transition, grid modernization and digitalization on a fast track as we leapfrog towards a Net Zero power sector in India. In the post pandemic world, it is imperative that utilities do not make the same mistakes but learn from each other, and from global expertise/experiences. Experts from leading utilities from the USA, Europe, Japan, South Korea and Japan will be invited to participate in DUM 2025 and share their valuable experiences.
